nSDL 1.1.1 Anniversary Edition
==============================

nSDL is a port of SDL for the TI-Nspire calculator.

To install nSDL, copy lib and include to the respective folders in your Ndless SDK folder.
To build your nSDL programs, use and adapt Makefile.sample.

For more information, have a look at the nSDL website: http://hoffa.github.com/nSDL/

Rebuilding SDL_image
====================

* Clone nSDL

  $ git clone git@github.com:hoffa/nSDL.git
  $ cd nSDL/tinspire/libs/SDL_image-1.2.12-r2/

* Build

  * The Makefile is not configured with autotools. Don't run the
    configure script!

  * Locate the headers for SDL in your Ndless setup
    e.g. /home/user/Source/ndless/ndless-sdk/include/SDL/

  * Then build the library with:

     $ INCLUDE="-I /home/user/Source/ndless/ndless-sdk/include/SDL/" make

     where you replace the include path in the prepended environment
     variable. If that doesn't work, edit the Makefile manually.

* Install static library

  * Copy the produced static library to your ndless installation:

    $ cp libSDL_image.a /home/user/Source/ndless/ndless-sdk/lib/
